# SeroHet
## Overview
SeroHet is a MATLAB-based software to study signatures of interpatient seroprotein heterogeneity in cancer patients. SeroHet requires three input files: a single tab-delimited .txt file containing the concentrations of each seroprotein, a single .txt file containing the names of the seroprotein, and a single .txt file containing sample IDs. Cancer type-, stage-, and other group-based SeroHet signature analyses are availabe through an optional input file containing the labels of each group. SeroHet is developed and maintained by Hanjun Lee (MIT/MGH/Broad). SeroHet signatures are also available from [here](https://hanjun.group/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SeroHet.v.1.0.classification.txt). 
## Installation
SeroHet is implemented in MATLAB. MATLAB version equal to or greater than R2019b is recommended. SeroHet has been tested in Windows, Mac, and Linux environments.
